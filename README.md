This will be an app that does job searches and will be able to auto-fill the website's application page and auto-upload 
the individuals resume.

Vision Statement:

Key Aspects/Features:
Collection of the most popular online job posting sites
Simplicity of job applications to companies
Storing resume for quick applications
Alerts for new job postings based on filters
Pros:
Allow users to save searches on jobs
Simple to use application
Android OS backwards compatibility allows for more focus on features rather than compatibility issues
Simplified development for dynamic screen sizes
Cons:
Competition
Detailed searching could be troublesome
New players in the job posting that would need to be developed for
Government specific job postings

Finding a job can be very difficult, but with all the options currently it is more and more difficult to gather all of the jobs and 
know which ones you have applied to and have not. With this app, it will consolidate the different sites and allow you to track each
application you have done.

Immediate Release:
    Connection to major job sites, saving search items, resume upload and storage, basic filter options (regions, job titles, etc) 
    all of which allow for the convenience of each user to simply apply for positions.
    
Future Goals:
    Job posting alerts, connection to companies (Cerner, Small companies, etc), auto-filling applications, user saved comments on 
    each job posting for notes.
